## Description 
These retrospective tools participate in enhancing your retrospectives, better organizing them, and following up actions over time.<br>It contains:
- [x] Visually, the application is divided into three identical columns (*"Good things", "Bad things" & "Action items"*), each contains an "Add" button and a list of added comments;
- [x] Each column is the same *reusable component* in which the name and background color are *configured*;

- [x] When you click the "Add" button, a form with a text box and a "Create" button *appears in its place*.
- [x] After writing the text, by clicking on the "Create" button, the comment appears in the proper column, the form disappears and the "Add" button returns to its place;
- [x] The top of each column shows the *name* of that column and the *number of comments* there;
- [x] The comment is a *reusable component*.
- [x] Each comment card contains a *rating counter*, which by default has a value of *0*;
- [x] The card shows the *date and time* the comment was created.
- [x] The cards within the column are *sorted by rating*, from top to bottom.

## Comments:

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
